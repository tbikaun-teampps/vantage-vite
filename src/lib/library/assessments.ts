    id: 1004,
    title: "Notification Process",
    question_text: "Are notifications written timely with sufficient detail? Are all defects captured in SAP at appropriate hierarchy levels? Are accurate failure modes captured? What is the ratio of notifications from operations vs maintenance?",
    context: "All work requests are recorded in SAP as Notifications, including reliability inspection findings. Adequate information includes what (fault description), where (maintainable item), when (occurrence and priority), and why (failure modes).",

    context: "Priorities of work must be determined based on set guidelines and in line with maintenance and operational requirements.",
